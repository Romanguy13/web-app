# Roadmap

## Phase 1: Accumulation
During this phase, the focus is on mining and lockdown. Mining refers to the process of generating new Thermcoins through computational power, typically using a proof-of-work algorithm. Miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems, and the successful miner is rewarded with newly minted Thermcoins. This process helps to secure the Thermcoin network and validate transactions. Lockdown refers to Thermcoin holders locking up their Thermcoins for a specified period of time. This process helps to reduce the circulating supply of Thermcoins and increase the scarcity of the asset. The combination of mining and lockdown helps to increase the value of Thermcoin and establish a strong foundation for the Thermcoin ecosystem.

## Phase 2: Joule
In this phase, the emphasis is on the development of a web wallet and the implementation of meta transactions. A web wallet is an online platform or application that allows users to securely store, manage, and transfer their Thermcoins. It provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with their Thermcoin holdings. Meta transactions, on the other hand, are a mechanism that enables users to perform transactions without directly paying for gas fees on the blockchain. Instead, a relayer covers the gas fees on behalf of the user, simplifying the transaction process and enhancing usability.

## Phase 3: Production
The main focus of this phase is the launch of the Thermcoin mainnet, which marks the transition from a test or development network to a fully functional blockchain network. The mainnet launch is a critical milestone as it represents the official release of Thermcoin's decentralized infrastructure. Additionally, the integration of Chainlink input oracle is a notable feature during this phase. Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides external data to the blockchain, allowing smart contracts on the Thermcoin network to interact with real-world information. The Chainlink input oracle enhances the functionality and versatility of Thermcoin's smart contract ecosystem.

These phases represent key stages in the development and progression of Thermcoin as a decentralized digital asset. Each phase contributes to the overall growth, adoption, and utility of Thermcoin within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
